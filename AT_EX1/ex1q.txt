1. Board file: every position is at a new line?
2.  Winner: 'or to eat all of its moving PIECEs' - it means that if the opponent is left only with a bomb and a flag then he looses?
3. move file: the position is 0-base or 1-base?
4. need to check for victory after every move?

3. Player tries to move piece to a location already occupied - caught
4. Attempt to move more than one square horizontally/vertically - caught
5. Game ended without any winner (moves files ended) - output file created successfully
6. Player 2 wins - captures opponent's flag - output file created successfully
7. Player 1's moves file includes bad formatted line - player 1 loses. Output file created successfully
8. Player 1 moves the joker AND changes it in same line - success 
9. Player 1 changes joker in a turn where a non-joker piece moves - success

11. Player 2 tries to change a joker with "J: <X> <Y> <CHAR>" where X, Y are empty - player 1 won
12. Player 2 eats player 1's last moving piece with a joker, when this joker is player 2's only/
    moving piece, and then changes it to Bomb - player 2 wins
13. Player 1 turns joker (only moving piece) to Bomb. Player 2's last moving piece explodes on 
	this bomb. Player 2 wins.
14. Player 2's last moving piece fights with player 1's last moving piece, they're equal and both
	are out. Player 2 wins
15. Both players position flags at the same spot in board files - tie
16. Player 1 positions 2 pieces on same sqaure in board file - illegal board file
17. Player 2's Paper explodes on player 1's Bomb - Paper and Bomb are off the board
18. Player 1 has Rock, Joker-Bomb and Flag.
	Rock loses game and Joker changes to Scissors - player 1 wins because he can move

FIXED BUGS:
1. Joker changes representation - see http://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=49041
    Solution: moved the testForJokerValidChange from checkMove to execMove (after updateBoardAfterMove)
2. Changing joker failed to catch cases of "J: <X> <Y> <CHAR>" where X, Y are empty/don't contain joker
3. In checkVictory - there is not scenario in which all moving pieces are eaten and there's a 
	tie. Fixed so that checkVictory checks for the player who just played
